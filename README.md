Herhackles is a game where you have to save the princess. Yeah I know it's original...

BUT we're in 2016 and in 2016, heroes have exchanged their swords for a more powerful weapon : a laptop ! <sup>(ok, some of them are still attached to their old-fashioned weapons)</sup>

Ready to hack the game ?
